**MERN Expense Tracker — Full Stack Financial Management System**

**Project Overview**

This application is a full-stack financial tracking system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
It allows users to securely manage personal expenses, monitor spending behavior, and visualize financial data through interactive analytics.

The system is designed with a RESTful backend, JWT-based authentication, and a responsive React frontend, following modern full-stack development practices.

Manages authentication state using JWT tokens

Displays financial data using charts and dashboards

Backend (Node.js + Express)

Provides RESTful API endpoints

Handles authentication and authorization

Performs business logic and data validation

Interacts with MongoDB using Mongoose

Database (MongoDB)
