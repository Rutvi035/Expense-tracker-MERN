**MERN Expense Tracker — Full Stack Financial Management System**

**Project Overview**

This application is a full-stack financial tracking system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
It allows users to securely manage personal expenses, monitor spending behavior, and visualize financial data through interactive analytics.

The system is designed with a RESTful backend, JWT-based authentication, and a responsive React frontend, following modern full-stack development practices.
